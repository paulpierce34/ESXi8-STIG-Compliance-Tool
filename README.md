# ESXi8-STIG-Compliance-Tool
This script automates the STIG check for ESXi 8 hosts. Simply replace values at the top of the script with your own (such as target IP address) and execute script for the STIG check to commence.

The tool was built for **VMware vSphere 8.0 ESXi Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 2 Benchmark Date: 30 Jan 2025**  specifically, but may be inaccurate for future versions dependent on DISA changes.
